## How to use
Everything is saved via local storage so you can just visit the website and edit the prefrences of your browser to redirect to that page.
On some browsers theres an extension called <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/new-tab-override/fjcmlondipcnnpmbcollgifldmajfonf">"Tab Override"</a> which lets you do this.

Note
* Since its saved in local storage, when you clear your cache all data will be lost, so save a file with your config if you want to save the data
